# Integrate FIDO2 authentication for 2FA on Firefox Account

**Mentor:** Vijay Budhram

**Email:** vbudhram@mozilla.com

## Project Description

To better help protect Firefox Account (FxA) users, we want add FIDO2 authentication as a second authentication factor.
Currently, FxA only supports one 2FA method via an [OTP code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password).
If a user loses access to the associated authenication device, possibly through
getting a new phone, they could get locked out of their account.

Having an additional option for 2FA could allow our users to regain access to their account
as well as provide more security.

## Skills Required

Applicants needs:

* Git, Github
* NodeJS, Javascript, CSS, HTML
* MySQL
* Good communication

## Project Details

The new 2FA method will involve integrating FIDO2 authentication which includes adding database tables, webservices and UX to support the new feature. Please reference the [feature doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RhwkeYJRvYZKRvtjVb-5N9KnJfwE2CwVTYT9FYwIpNY/edit#) to get more ideas on the proposal.
